# Evo2 7B Fine-Tuning Guide (gputee)

*Last updated: 2026-05-14 (audit pass: H1 faithful resume, H3 prefix
loss masking, H6 adaptive seq-budget slack; L=32k pilot **must** use
`--batch-size 1 --grad-accum 128` to fit on the 80 GB H100).*

Everything needed to fine-tune Evo2 7B on the combined BGC training dataset.
Covers hardware constraints, hyperparameter rationale, what to log, what to
watch for, and how to resume from a checkpoint. Read this before starting a run.

**Hardware context:** this copy of the guide is for the `gputee` host
(1× NVIDIA H100 PCIe, 80 GB). The archived `docs/trojai/FINETUNE_GUIDE.md`
documents the original 4× NVIDIA A40 analysis. Numbers marked
**(trojai)** are from the A40 smoke tests and kept only as historical
reference.

> **Update 2026-05-14 — micro-batch reality at L=32k.** The
> production-like preflight in §4 / §12.7.1 used `--batch-size 4
> --grad-accum 32`. The first real pilot at L=32,768 with those

> backward. The only configuration that fits at L=32,768 on this 80 GB

## 1  Hardware and memory constraints

### Available GPU

```
GPU 0: NVIDIA H100 PCIe  80 GB VRAM  (81,559 MiB per nvidia-smi)
Driver 575.64.03 / CUDA 12.9 runtime
```

There is only one GPU. All training runs use `deepspeed --num_gpus=1`.

### Why full-parameter fine-tuning still doesn't fit

Evo2 7B has 6.51 billion trainable params. In bf16 mixed precision the
baseline memory need for a full fine-tune is:

| Component                         |    Size |
| --------------------------------- | ------: |
| Model weights (bf16)              |   14 GB |
| Gradients (bf16)                  |   14 GB |
| AdamW optimizer states (fp32 m+v) |   56 GB |
| **Total (no activations)**        | **84 GB** |

84 GB > 80 GB, so full fine-tuning does not fit on the gputee H100
even before we count StripedHyena's activation tensors. On trojai the
same 84 GB was reached by sharding optimizer + grads across 4 ranks via
DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 (≈ 31.5 GB/rank budget, under the 46 GB A40 limit) —
but smoke testing showed activations ate the remaining 14 GB and OOM'd
at `optimizer.step()`. That analysis is preserved verbatim in
`docs/trojai/FINETUNE_GUIDE.md` §1; see §12 below for the recorded
smoke-test evidence.

On gputee the options for making the full 84 GB fit on a single 80 GB
GPU would be:

| Option                             | Memory saving                         | Implementation risk |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **LoRA (current choice)**          | ~167× drop in optimizer state         | Low — already working; only needs re-smoke on H100 |
| ZeRO-3 with CPU/NVMe offload       | Weights offloaded to host RAM / disk  | High — Evo2's vortex loader resists ZeRO-3 sharding; also slow |
| 8-bit AdamW (bitsandbytes)         | 4× optimizer state                    | Medium — new dependency; unknown interaction with StripedHyena |
| FP8 full fine-tune (Transformer Engine) | ~2× weights + optimizer overall  | High — new dependency; Evo2 not FP8-native |

**LoRA is still the correct choice on gputee.** Freezing the base weights
drops the optimizer-state term from ~56 GB to ~336 MB (≈ 28.7 M trainable
params × 12 B per AdamW slot), leaving the ~14 GB of frozen bf16 weights
and forward/backward activations as the only significant memory consumers.

### Activations: what the StripedHyena filter does to memory

On trojai the dominant activation cost was the Hyena long-convolution
filter (`compute_filter`), which materialises a
`[poles × channels × L]` tensor in every forward pass. The trojai
measurements (with ZeRO-2 across 4 ranks) were:

| Sequence length | Peak per rank (A40 ZeRO-2, trojai) |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------: |
| L = 1,024       | 23.2 GB                            |
| L = 4,096       | ~43 GB (tight)                     |
| L = 8,192+      | OOM                                |

On gputee (world_size = 1, no ZeRO sharding) the same forward-pass
memory lands on a single GPU, but the 14 GB of bf16 weights that were
replicated on every trojai rank are still just 14 GB here (not 4× 14 GB).
The net effect on peak memory is not a simple scale — it needs to be
re-measured. Specifically: **do not** assume the A40 L=4096 OOM transfers
to H100; an 80 GB H100 with LoRA (no replicated fp32 master, no ZeRO
overhead) should have materially more headroom at the same L than a
ZeRO-2 A40 rank did. This is the first thing the H100 smoke benchmark
(§12.7 below) needs to pin down.

### Why BioNeMo is still not used

NVIDIA BioNeMo Framework 2 (`bionemo-evo2`) wraps Evo2 for fine-tuning
via NeMo/Megatron-LM. It is the most production-ready option but requires
a Docker container and is designed for multi-node H100 clusters. It is
not installed on gputee, and the single-GPU use case is a bad fit.
PyTorch + DeepSpeed + peft, with the per-script fixes already in place,
gives equivalent capability with more transparency.

BioNeMo's fine-tuning examples remain useful as a reference for hyperparameter
defaults and sequence packing implementation:

## 2  Required installations (one-time)

The `bgcmodel` env on gputee was (re-)created from scratch via micromamba
(see `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` §3.1); it was not carried over from trojai. The
pinned training-stack additions that are **not in `environment.yml`** and
must be installed explicitly after the env create:

```
deepspeed  0.18.9
wandb      0.26.0
peft       0.19.0     ← LoRA adapters
```

### Fresh-install procedure (the sequence that actually works)

`environment.yml` lists both `torch==2.5.1+cu124` and
`flash-attn==2.7.4.post1` in its pip section. A naive
`micromamba env create -f environment.yml` fails because pip runs its
dependency resolution once across the whole pip list, and flash-attn's
`setup.py` does `import torch` at build time — but torch isn't installed
in the target env yet when that happens. The conda-side of the env does
finish cleanly; only the pip phase crashes.

The working sequence (tested on gputee 2026-04-22):

```bash
# 1. conda-side env (this succeeds; flash-attn failure is non-fatal here)
micromamba create -n bgcmodel -f environment.yml   # pip step will fail on flash-attn — ignore
micromamba activate bgcmodel

# 2. torch first. The index-url is required; it points at the cu124 wheel.
pip install torch==2.5.1+cu124 torchvision==0.20.1+cu124 \
    --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

# 3. flash-attn. The prebuilt wheel from GitHub matches this stack exactly
#    (cu12 + torch2.5 + cp312 + cxx11abiFALSE). Avoids a 10-min source build
#    AND avoids the known setup.py EXDEV bug that triggers when /tmp and
#    the pip cache live on different filesystems (which is the case on
#    gputee: /tmp is on / and the pip cache is on /home).
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.7.4.post1/flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.5cxx11abiFALSE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl
pip install ./flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.5cxx11abiFALSE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl
rm flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.5cxx11abiFALSE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl

# 4. resume environment.yml's pip list (torch + flash-attn are now satisfied
#    and will be skipped; the remaining packages install cleanly)
cd ~/projects/BCGModelling
micromamba env update -n bgcmodel -f environment.yml

# 5. the three training-only deps that are NOT in environment.yml
pip install deepspeed==0.18.9 peft==0.19.0 wandb==0.26.0
```

Version verification after the env is built:

```bash
micromamba activate bgcmodel
python - <<'PY'
import importlib.metadata as md
import torch, transformers, peft, deepspeed, evo2, flash_attn

def ver(pkg):
    try: return md.version(pkg)
    except md.PackageNotFoundError: return "?"

print("torch         ", torch.__version__, "cuda", torch.version.cuda)
print("transformers  ", transformers.__version__)
print("peft          ", peft.__version__)
print("deepspeed     ", deepspeed.__version__)
print("evo2          ", ver("evo2"))
print("flash_attn    ", flash_attn.__version__)
print("cuda_available", torch.cuda.is_available(),
      "device_count", torch.cuda.device_count(),
      "device_name", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else None)

from evo2 import Evo2
print("Evo2 class   ", Evo2)
PY
```

Expected on gputee: `cuda_available=True`, `device_count=1`,
`device_name=NVIDIA H100 PCIe`. Note that the `evo2` package does not
export a `__version__` attribute, so the metadata lookup above is the
correct way to read its version.

### Storage layout on gputee

`/home` on gputee is tight (1.8 TB, ~30–40 GB free as of 2026-04-22).
Two large shared filesystems provide the actual working space:

| Path | Size | Free (2026-04-22) | Use |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `/home` | 1.8 TB | ~30 GB | code (`~/projects/BCGModelling`), env (`~/.local/share/mamba/envs/bgcmodel`), shell state |
| `/data2` | 7 TB | ~1.5 TB | HuggingFace cache, per-run output dirs, training logs |
| `/data` | 7 TB | ~420 GB | alternative if `/data2` fills |

Required environment variable (add to `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
# HuggingFace cache on /data2 — Evo2 7B is ~14 GB, /home cannot hold it
export HF_HOME=/data2/ds85/hf_cache
```

Create the cache directory once:
```bash
mkdir -p /data2/ds85/hf_cache
```

Per-run output directories should live on `/data2` too. The documented
pattern is:
```bash
--output-dir /data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/<run_name>
```

Even after the LoRA checkpoint fix (§11), long runs produce adapter
checkpoints, plots, offline wandb logs, and sample FASTA files that add
up to hundreds of MB per run — comfortable on `/data2`, unpleasant on
`/home`.

### WandB login

Before your first online-mode run:
```bash
micromamba activate bgcmodel
wandb login  # paste API key from wandb.ai/authorize
```
For smoke benchmarks, use `--wandb-mode offline` to skip this entirely.

## 3  Training data

| Split | Records  | File                                            |
| ----- | -------: | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Train | 277,238  | `data/processed/splits_combined/train.jsonl`    |
| Val   |  34,655  | `data/processed/splits_combined/val.jsonl`      |
| Test  |  34,655  | `data/processed/splits_combined/test.jsonl`     |

All records use **Phase 1 conditioning format** — `COMPOUND` token stripped:
```
|COMPOUND_CLASS:{cls}|{tax_tag}{sequence}
```

MIBiG and antiSMASH DB records are identical in format. The `training_text` field
in each JSONL record is the exact string to feed to the model.

### Sequence length profile (train set)

| Length range | Records  |    % |
| ------------ | -------: | ---: |
| < 5 kb       |    1,180 |  0.4% |
| 5 – 20 kb    |   48,301 | 17.4% |
| 20 – 50 kb   |  183,000 | 66.0% |
| 50 – 100 kb  |   38,774 | 14.0% |
| 100 – 262 kb |    5,983 |  2.2% |

Median: **22,951 bp** · p90: 58,859 bp · p99: 123,724 bp

**Long-sequence handling (`scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py`, May 2026).** `--max-seq-len`
is the maximum **tokenizer positions** per training example (prefix + nucleotide
window). Two modes:

1. **`--long-seq-strategy truncate` (default)** — Legacy path: tokenize the full
   `training_text` string, then clip token IDs to `--max-seq-len`. Only the head of
   long clusters is supervised each step. The **L=32k pilot** in `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`
   §13 stays on this default so it matches earlier smoke/pilot behaviour.
2. **`--long-seq-strategy chunk` (production)** — Deterministic **nucleotide** tiling.
   The conditioning prefix is **not guessed**: Phase 1 rows match
   ``|COMPOUND_CLASS:{compound_class}|{taxonomic_tag}`` from JSON fields (with a
   fallback slice of `training_text` if a future corpus diverges). **By default**
   (`--auto-prefix-budget`, on unless `--no-auto-prefix-budget`): rank 0 scans the
   whole split once with the Evo2 tokenizer, records **`max_prefix_tokens`** in
   `<split>.lengths.meta.json` (tagged with the Evo2 checkpoint id), and every
   chunk uses `max_seq_len - max_prefix_tokens` nucleotides of `sequence` per
   window—so the prefix is never clipped as long as the scan matches the tokenizer
   used at training. With **`--no-auto-prefix-budget`**, a fixed **`--prefix-budget`**
   (default 256) is used instead (legacy / reproducibility). Consecutive windows
   overlap by **`--chunk-overlap`** nucleotides (default **2048**); stride =
   `(max_seq_len - prefix_token_cap) - chunk_overlap`. **Train and val** each use
   their own scanned cap from their respective meta files. Absolute `val_loss` /
   perplexity are **not comparable** to truncate-only runs.

**Sidecars (chunk mode).** Before the first chunked run, build (or let rank 0
auto-build) per-JSONL length caches next to the split files (or under
`--lengths-cache-dir`, default: parent of `--train`):

- `data/processed/splits_combined/<split>.lengths.npy` — `int32` length of
  `sequence` per JSONL line
- `data/processed/splits_combined/<split>.lengths.meta.json` — fingerprint
  (`path`, `size`, `mtime`, `count`) so stale caches are rebuilt when the JSONL
  changes; after the first chunked run (with `--auto-prefix-budget`) also holds
  `max_prefix_tokens` and `max_prefix_tokens_evo_tag` for reproducible windowing.

One-shot pre-build / chunk-count preview:

```bash
python scripts/build_chunk_index.py \
  --jsonl data/processed/splits_combined/train.jsonl \
          data/processed/splits_combined/val.jsonl \
          data/processed/splits_combined/test.jsonl \
  --max-seq-len 32768 --chunk-overlap 2048
```

**Production launch (gputee):** add
`--long-seq-strategy chunk --chunk-overlap 2048` to the §13 templates in
`PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (optional `--lengths-cache-dir` if train/val live outside the
same directory). `train_log.jsonl` rows include `first_record_idx`,
`first_nt_start`, `first_nt_end` (from the first sample in the logged micro-batch)
for windowing audits.

Residual notes (unchanged trade-offs):

- **Train / inference length mismatch** can remain if you generate longer
  sequences at inference than `max_seq_len`; chunking improves *coverage* of
  native-length training clusters but does not remove the need to validate
  long outputs separately.
- **Pushing `L` past 32k** is still gated on H100 memory (§12.7); chunking is
  orthogonal to the `--max-seq-len` knob.

## 4  Hyperparameters

**Active script: `scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py`** (LoRA, smoke-test passed ✅)
Reference script: `scripts/finetune_evo2.py` (full fine-tune, memory wall — see §12)

All defaults are baked into the script and saved to `config.json` at run start.
Override via CLI flags.

### LoRA-specific hyperparameters (`finetune_evo2_lora.py`)

| Parameter          | Value  | Rationale                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--lora-r`         | `16`   | Adapter rank. Gives 28.7M trainable params (0.44% of 6.5B). Increase to 32/64 if val loss plateaus early. |
| `--lora-alpha`     | `32`   | Scaling = alpha/r = 2.0. Standard starting value.                 |
| `--lora-dropout`   | `0.05` | Light regularisation on adapter paths.                             |
| `--lora-targets`   | (see below) | All Linear layers: Wqkv, out_proj, out_filter_dense, l1, l2, l3 |

**LoRA target modules** cover all 133 `nn.Linear` layers in Evo2 7B:
- Attention (5 blocks × `Wqkv` + `out_proj`): ~1.6M params
- Hyena filter output (27 blocks × `out_filter_dense`): ~3.7M params
- MLP (32 blocks × `l1`, `l2`, `l3`): ~23.2M params
- **Total trainable: 28.7M / 6.51B = 0.44%**

### Core training hyperparameters

| Parameter              | LoRA value | Full FT value | Rationale                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--lr`                 | `5e-5`     | `1e-5`        | Higher LR for adapters is standard (adapters are randomly initialised) |
| `--lr-min-ratio`       | `0.1`      | `0.1`         | Cosine decay floor = 10% of peak                   |
| `--warmup-steps`       | `200`      | `200`         | ~1% of first epoch                                 |
| `--batch-size`         | `1` (gputee L=32k); `4` (script default) | `1`/`4` | Sequences per GPU per micro-step. **At L=32,768 on this 80 GB H100, only `1` fits** (audit 2026-05-14); `4` is the historical multi-GPU default kept for reproducibility. |
| `--grad-accum`         | `128` (gputee L=32k); `8` (script default) | `128`/`8` | Effective batch = `batch_size × grad_accum × world_size`. Tuned for **128 sequences/step**. |
| `--max-seq-len`        | `32768`    | `32768`       | Max tokens per example (prefix + sequence window); see §3 chunk vs truncate |
| `--long-seq-strategy`  | `chunk` (production); `truncate` (pilot) | same | `truncate` = head clip; **`chunk`** = full nt coverage. **Production must use `chunk`**; the L=32k pilot keeps `truncate` to stay comparable to earlier smoke metrics. See §3. |
| `--chunk-overlap`      | `2048`     | `2048`        | Nucleotide overlap between windows (`chunk` mode only) |
| `--auto-prefix-budget` | on         | on            | Scan split → store `max_prefix_tokens` + `prefix_slack_tokens` in meta; chunk windows use `L - max_prefix_tokens - slack` (`chunk` mode). Slack is 0 under Evo2's CharLevelTokenizer; the scan re-measures it on every fresh build. |
| `--no-auto-prefix-budget` | —      | —             | Force fixed `--prefix-budget` for every row (`chunk` mode) |
| `--prefix-budget`      | `256`      | `256`         | Fixed prefix token cap when `--no-auto-prefix-budget` (`chunk` mode) |
| `--prefix-slack-tokens`| `0`        | `0`           | Floor for the tokenizer-overflow slack persisted in `<split>.lengths.meta.json`. With CharLevelTokenizer the measured slack is 0; raise only if a tokenizer change starts merging across the prefix↔sequence seam (audit H6). |
| `--max-epochs`         | `2`        | `2`           | ~4,332 steps at one record per dataset index; chunk steps/epoch depend on scanned prefix cap (see §3) |
| `--weight-decay`       | `0.01`     | `0.1`         | Lower for LoRA — heavy WD hurts tiny adapter params |
| `--grad-clip`          | `1.0`      | `1.0`         | Max gradient norm                                  |
| `--beta1`              | `0.9`      | `0.9`         | Standard AdamW                                     |
| `--beta2`              | `0.95`     | `0.95`        | From Evo2 paper                                    |
| `--seed`               | `42`       | `42`          | Reproducibility                                    |

### Effective batch size and throughput

The script defaults (`batch_size=4`, `grad_accum=8`) were chosen for
`world_size=4` on trojai:

```
trojai (4× A40):   4 seq/GPU × 4 GPUs × 8 grad-accum = 128 sequences/effective step
```

On gputee `world_size=1`. The original gputee migration plan was to
keep `batch_size=4` and bump `grad_accum=32` so that
`4 × 1 × 32 = 128` matched trojai. **That micro-batch shape does not
fit at L=32,768 on the 80 GB H100** (audit 2026-05-14: `bs=4` OOM'd on
forward, `bs=2` OOM'd on backward). The only configuration that fits
the L=32,768 target is `--batch-size 1 --grad-accum 128`:

```
gputee (1× H100), L=32k recommended:    1 × 1 × 128 = 128 sequences/effective step
```

The mathematical gradient is unchanged: an effective batch of 128 is
128 regardless of how the 128 sequences are split between micro-batch
and accumulation. The LoRA defaults (`--lr`, `--weight-decay`, betas,
warmup) were tuned against 128 sequences and remain valid; no retune
is needed for the bs=1 ga=128 split.

**Cost trade-off.** The bs=1 ga=128 split processes 128 micro-batches
sequentially rather than 32 batches of 4 in parallel. Per-token
throughput drops because (a) GPU work is more launch-overhead-bound at
batch=1, and (b) every checkpointed activation has to be recomputed
once per micro-batch. The §4 wall-clock table is being re-derived from
the current L=32k pilot's `tokens_per_sec`; until that pilot logs a
real number, treat the previous 3,275 tok/s figure (which was measured
at the no-longer-feasible bs=4 ga=32 settings) as an **upper bound,
not a target**.

The smaller-L preflight numbers in the next table reflect the historical
bs=4 ga=32 setting and are kept for reference / for any future run at
shorter context lengths that does fit at higher micro-batch.

### Memory at runtime

Three sub-tables — A40 history for context, then the two measured gputee
sweeps that are now load-bearing. All runs are LoRA `r=16` on Evo2 7B;
the AC sweep uses the default-on block-level activation checkpointing
(see §12.7).

**Historical — trojai (4× A40 ZeRO-2, LoRA, batch=1):**

| Sequence length | Peak GPU memory (rank 0) | Status |
|---|---:|---|

| L         | Peak GPU mem | Throughput | Notes |
|-----------|-------------:|-----------:|-------|
| 40,960    | 52.16 GB     | ~3,475 tok/s | 20 steps; loss stable in 0.74–0.86 band |

Run root: `/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/queued_preflight_20260427_110056/`.
Summary table: `.../summary.tsv`. **This is the load-bearing evidence
for L choice in production** because it uses real
batch-size/grad-accum/collation conditions, not the smoke setup.

Decision-relevant facts:
1. L=32,768 fits comfortably (43.92 GB peak under smoke; under
   production-like settings it would scale up but still has ample
   margin) and is the conservative production default.
2. L=65,536 is feasible under production-like settings at 74.17 GB
   (~6 GB of headroom on 80 GB) and is the stretch target.
3. Block-level activation checkpointing is **required** to reach
   L≥16,384 — without it the no-AC path fails. AC is default-on in
   `scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py` since 2026-04-26.
4. `expandable_segments` allocator tuning is **not** supported on this
   host (confirmed by the no-AC OOM trace). Do not rely on it.

### Steps and time estimate

With `--batch-size 1 --grad-accum 128` (mandatory at L=32k on gputee):

```
277,238 records / (1 seq × 1 GPU × 128 accum) = ~2,166 steps/epoch
2 epochs = ~4,332 steps total
```

The step count is unchanged vs the historical 4×32 plan because the
effective batch is still 128. **What changes is wall-clock per step.**

> **Wall-clock is being re-measured.** The preflight 3,275 tok/s
> figure was measured at `bs=4, ga=32`. At `bs=1, ga=128` the GPU
> launches 128 sequential forward+backward+optimiser-recompute passes
> per optimiser step, which is slower per token than 32 batches of 4
> (smaller GEMMs, more launch overhead, more checkpoint recomputes).
> The current L=32k pilot at `bs=1, ga=128` will give the
> **load-bearing** wall-clock number — fill in this section from the
> first ~50 steps of `train_log.jsonl` (its `tokens_per_sec` column)
> once the pilot crosses the val/save boundary at step 10.

Until the pilot has logged real numbers, treat the below as a
**stale-but-bounded** reference (the bs=4 ga=32 wall-clocks are an
**optimistic lower bound** because we cannot actually run them at
L=32k):

| L target | Tokens/step | Lower-bound step time @ 3,275 tok/s | Lower-bound wall-clock (4,332 steps) |
|----------|-----------:|------------------------------------:|--------------------------------------|
| 32,768   | 4.19 M     | ~21.4 min                            | **≥ ~64 hours (~2.7 days)** — real number expected to be larger |
| 65,536   | 8.39 M     | ~42.7 min                            | **≥ ~128 hours (~5.3 days)** — bs/ga shape still TBD at this L  |

Once the pilot reports `tokens_per_sec` at `bs=1 ga=128 L=32k`,
recompute as `step_time ≈ tokens_per_step / measured_tok_per_sec` and
overwrite this table; the rest of the run-time estimate machinery
(±20% drift, validation pauses, checkpoint writes) carries over.

> **Activation checkpointing overhead is already baked in** to whatever
> `tokens_per_sec` the trainer logs. The "1F+1B → 2F+1B" ~1.33× factor
> is *inside* the measured throughput; do **not** apply it again on top.

## 5  What to record — required logging

If a run crashes and you haven't checkpointed, you lose days of compute.
The training script enforces all of the following.

### At run start (once)

- `{output_dir}/config.json` — all hyperparameters, data file paths, git commit hash,
  hostname, timestamp, CUDA/driver version
- `{output_dir}/data_fingerprint.txt` — line count of each split + SHA256 of first
  100 lines (verifies data hasn't changed between runs)
- `{output_dir}/env.txt` — full `pip freeze` output (exact package versions)

### Every 10 steps (cheap, always on)

```json
{"step": 1240, "epoch": 0.57, "train_loss": 1.823, "lr": 9.8e-6,
 "grad_norm": 0.42, "gpu_mem_gb": [34.1, 33.9, 34.2, 34.0],
 "tokens_per_sec": 18400, "elapsed_sec": 37200}
```

Written to `{output_dir}/train_log.jsonl` and streamed to WandB.

### Every 250 steps (~2–3 hrs)

- Validation loss on 2,000 randomly sampled val sequences
- Validation perplexity (= exp(val_loss))
- Written to `{output_dir}/val_log.jsonl` and WandB

### Every 500 steps (~5–6 hrs)

**Checkpoint** saved to `{output_dir}/checkpoints/step_{N}/`:
```
step_{N}/
  model_weights.pt          # model state dict
  optimizer_state.pt        # DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 optimizer shards
  scheduler_state.pt        # LR scheduler state
  step.txt                  # step number for easy resume
```

**Generation sample** — 4 sequences generated (one per class: PKS/NRPS/TERPENE/RIPP)
with *E. coli* taxonomy tag, saved to `{output_dir}/samples/step_{N}.fasta`.
M1 (antiSMASH class prediction) and M2 (Pfam domain check) run automatically;
results written to `{output_dir}/samples/step_{N}_eval.json`.

### Checkpoint retention policy

Keep: **last 5 checkpoints** + **best validation loss checkpoint** (tagged `best/`).
Delete older checkpoints automatically to stay within disk budget (~28 GB/checkpoint).

---

## 6  Launch command

**Use `finetune_evo2_lora.py`.** The full-parameter script (`finetune_evo2.py`)
does not fit on gputee's 80 GB H100 (84 GB base budget) and OOM'd on trojai
(see §12). The LoRA script has passed:

- trojai smoke (10 steps, L=1024, 4× A40) — 2026-04-15
- gputee smoke benchmark sweep, no-AC (L=1024 → 8192) — 2026-04-25
- gputee smoke benchmark sweep, AC on (L=1024 → 65,536) — 2026-04-26
- gputee **production-like preflight** (real batch=4, grad-accum=32, AC on,
  L=40,960 → 65,536, 20 steps each) — 2026-04-29 → 2026-05-01

> **⚠️ Remaining prerequisite before a multi-day production launch:** run
> a short **L=32,768 pilot on real combined splits** (see
> `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` §13 NEXT). The preflight above validated memory and
> throughput but only for 20 steps each L — it never reached the first
> `--val-every 250` or `--save-every 500` boundary. The pilot is the
> first end-to-end exercise of the validation cadence, checkpoint write
> path (with `exclude_frozen_parameters=True`, see §12.8), and
> resume-from-checkpoint semantics on real data.

### Pre-flight checks

```bash
micromamba activate bgcmodel
export HF_HOME=/data2/ds85/hf_cache   # critical — see §2 "Storage layout"

# 1. GPU must be idle (host is shared)
nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=pid,used_gpu_memory,gpu_uuid --format=csv
# Should return header only. Any resident process > 500 MB on the H100 will
# eat into the training budget. For unattended launches use
# scripts/queue_h100_smoke.sh / scripts/queue_h100_preflight.sh which gate
# on idleness + free memory before kicking off the trainer.

# 2. Data + binaries are present
python scripts/check_data_eval_readiness.py --json > readiness.json
cat readiness.json
# Want every "required: yes" entry to show "status: ready" — see
# docs/gputee/readiness_snapshots/readiness_20260428_104336.json for a
# reference green snapshot. Archive a fresh snapshot alongside any
# production launch.

# 3. Disk space — /data2 is the relevant volume, NOT /home
df -h /data2 /home
# Production runs land entirely on /data2 (HF cache + run outputs).
# /home is essentially full (~16 GB free) and is fine as long as no run
# output is misrouted to it. /data2 should have hundreds of GB free.

# 4. HF cache state
du -sh /data2/ds85/hf_cache/hub/models--arcinstitute--evo2_7b_262k 2>/dev/null
# Expect ~13–14 GB. If empty, the first model load will download it
# (~14 GB, takes 5–15 min depending on bandwidth) — budget accordingly.

# 5. WandB auth (only needed for `--wandb-mode online`)
python -c "import netrc, os; n=netrc.netrc(os.path.expanduser('~/.netrc')); print('wandb auth OK:', bool(n.hosts.get('api.wandb.ai')))"
```

### Smoke test (run before every real training run)

```bash
export HF_HOME=/data2/ds85/hf_cache
deepspeed --num_gpus=1 \
  scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py \
  --train data/processed/splits_combined/val.jsonl \
  --val   data/processed/splits_combined/val.jsonl \
  --output-dir /data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/smoketest_lora \
  --max-seq-len 1024 --batch-size 1 --grad-accum 1 \
  --warmup-steps 2 --max-epochs 1 --max-steps 10 \
  --log-every 1 --val-every 5 --save-every 10 --val-max-batches 4 \
  --wandb-project bcg-evo2-phase1
```

Expected output on gputee (key lines to verify):
```
[rank0] World size: 1
[rank0] Fixed 10 tensors  (X cloned out of inference mode)         ← count differs from trojai (see §12.6)
[rank0] LoRA applied: r=16  alpha=32  dropout=0.05
[rank0] Trainable params: 28,704,768 / 6,509,764,352  (0.441%)
[rank0] step     1 | ep 0.00 | loss X.XXXX | lr X.XXe-XX | ...
[rank0] VAL @ step 5: loss X.XXXX  ppl X.XXX
[rank0] Adapter saved → /data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/smoketest_lora/checkpoints/step_10/adapter
[rank0] Done. step=10  best_val_loss=X.XXXX
```

The trojai smoke test printed "Fixed 40 tensors" because it fixes tensors
on every rank; at `world_size=1` only rank-0's tensors are fixed, so the
count will be 1/4 of the trojai number. The `LoRA applied` and
`Trainable params` lines should match exactly — they depend only on the
model architecture and LoRA config, not on GPU count.

### Production launch

Activation checkpointing is **default-on** in
`scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py` as of 2026-04-26 — no `--activation-checkpointing`
flag needed. Pass `--no-activation-checkpointing` only if you explicitly
want the no-AC path (constrained to `L≤4096` per §12.7).

**Template A — conservative (recommended for the first multi-day run):**

```bash
TS=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
export HF_HOME=/data2/ds85/hf_cache
deepspeed --num_gpus=1 \
  scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py \
  --train               data/processed/splits_combined/train.jsonl \
  --val                 data/processed/splits_combined/val.jsonl \
  --output-dir          /data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/phase1_lora_prod_${TS}_L32768 \
  --max-seq-len         32768 \
  --batch-size          1 \
  --grad-accum          128 \
  --long-seq-strategy   chunk \
  --chunk-overlap       2048 \
  --lr                  5e-5 \
  --lora-r              16 \
  --lora-alpha          32 \
  --warmup-steps        200 \
  --max-epochs          2 \
  --save-every          500 \
  --val-every           250 \
  --wandb-project       bcg-evo2-phase1 \
  --seed                42
```

**Template B — stretch (L=65,536):** identical to template A but with
`--max-seq-len 65536` and output dir `..._L65536`. The
`--batch-size 1 --grad-accum 128` micro-batch shape is mandatory at
L=32k and almost certainly also at L=65k (the preflight at bs=4 ga=32
ran at L≤65k in 20-step bursts but never crossed a save/val boundary;
the next-step VRAM headroom at bs=1 ga=128 has not yet been measured
at L=65k). Only use Template B after a short L=65,536 pilot has
confirmed val cadence + checkpoint behaviour at that length (see
`PROJECT_GUIDE.md` §13.1 "decision gate").

Both templates produce identical step counts (~2,166/epoch, ~4,332 over
2 epochs at the 128-sequence effective batch). Wall-clock estimates
are now placeholders pending the L=32k pilot's first `tokens_per_sec`
log entry:

| Template | Wall-clock (TBD; see §4) | Peak GPU mem |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------|
| A — L=32,768 | re-derive from pilot `tokens_per_sec` at bs=1 ga=128 | TBD at bs=1 ga=128 (≤ 74 GB at bs=4 ga=32 was historical) |
| B — L=65,536 | re-derive after L=65k pilot | TBD at bs=1 ga=128 |

> **Note on `--batch-size 1 --grad-accum 128`:** required to fit
> L=32,768 on the 80 GB H100 (audit 2026-05-14). The script default
> `--batch-size 4 --grad-accum 8` was tuned for a 4-GPU world and OOMs
> at L=32k on a single H100. See §4 "Effective batch size and

>
> **Note on `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`:** this

> the 2026-04-25 no-AC OOM trace) — passing it is a harmless no-op. It
> has been removed from every launch command in this guide and from
> `scripts/queue_h100_pilot.sh`. Do not re-add it.
>
> **Note on `--long-seq-strategy chunk`:** production runs must use
> chunk mode so every nucleotide is supervised across deterministic
> windows (see §3). The L=32k pilot stays on `truncate` only to keep
> its metrics comparable to earlier truncate-mode smoke runs; once
> chunk is locked in, val_loss / perplexity values are not directly
> comparable to the pilot.
>
> **Note on `--no-activation-checkpointing`:** only relevant for the
> no-AC baseline. Practically capped at `L≤4096` due to OOM beyond. The
> production-like preflight and both templates above run with AC on.

### Resuming from a checkpoint

```bash
export HF_HOME=/data2/ds85/hf_cache
deepspeed --num_gpus=1 \
  scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py \
  --train         data/processed/splits_combined/train.jsonl \
  --val           data/processed/splits_combined/val.jsonl \
  --output-dir    /data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/phase1_lora \
  --resume-from   /data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/phase1_lora/checkpoints/step_2000 \
  [... same flags as original run ...]
```

Resume reloads (post-H1, audit 2026-05-14):

1. LoRA adapter weights from `checkpoints/step_N/adapter/` via
   `PeftModel.from_pretrained`. **Hard fail** if `--resume-from` is set
   but the directory or its `adapter/` subdir is missing (audit M7) —
   the old behaviour silently fell back to a fresh adapter.
2. DeepSpeed optimizer + scheduler state from the ZeRO partition files.
3. From `client_state`:
   - `step` (global optimizer step counter).
   - `best_val_loss`.
   - `epoch` + `micro_step_in_epoch` (data-stream resume position).
   - `rng_state` (Python + NumPy + torch CPU + torch CUDA per-rank
     RNG snapshots).

The trainer then calls `train_sampler.set_epoch(epoch)` so the
DistributedSampler yields the same shuffled order as the original run,
and skips forward through `enumerate(train_loader)` by
`micro_step_in_epoch` items before entering the training body. This
makes resume **faithful**: the data stream and RNG-dependent ops
(LoRA dropout, augmentation, etc.) reproduce exactly what an
uninterrupted run would have produced from the same checkpoint.

> **Constraint.** World size at resume must match world size at save
> (each rank's `client_state` is reloaded by the same rank index).
> Single-GPU on gputee means this is moot today, but it matters if we
> ever go multi-GPU.
>
> **Legacy checkpoints (pre-H1)** that lack `epoch` /
> `micro_step_in_epoch` / `rng_state` keys still resume: `epoch=0`,
> `micro_step_in_epoch=0`, seed-only RNG. `step` and `best_val_loss`
> are still respected, so the optimiser / LR schedule pick up where
> they left off; only the data-stream-from-resume invariant is
> weaker for legacy resumes.

## 7  Warning signs during training

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
| ------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Loss spikes then recovers in first 200 steps | Normal LR warmup | Ignore |
| Loss spike after warmup (step > 200) | LR too high | Stop, halve `--lr`, resume from last checkpoint |
| Loss plateaus at > 3.0 after 500 steps | Data pipeline error or LR too low | Check that `training_text` format is correct; verify tokeniser |
| Val loss rises while train loss falls | Overfitting | Stop early; use best-val checkpoint for generation |
| `nan` in `grad_norm` | Exploding gradients or corrupt batch | Gradient clipping should catch this; if persistent, check data for non-ACGTN characters |
| GPU memory increasing step-over-step | Memory leak in data loader | Restart from last checkpoint; check `del` and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` in loader |
| `tokens_per_sec` drops 50%+ mid-run | Long sequence batch hit | Expected variance; batches containing 100K+ sequences are slower |
| Peak GPU memory approaching 80 GB   | Sequence length too large; no activation checkpointing | Reduce `--max-seq-len`, or enable block-level checkpointing (see §13 NEXT) |

## 8  Expected training trajectory

Based on similar genomic LM fine-tuning runs (GenSLMs, HyenaDNA, NucleotideTransformer):

| Phase | Steps | Expected train loss | Expected val loss |
| ----- | ----: | ------------------: | ----------------: |
| Warmup | 0–200 | 3.5 → 2.5 (dropping fast) | — |
| Early | 200–1000 | 2.5 → 2.0 | ~2.2 |
| Mid | 1000–2500 | 2.0 → 1.7 | ~1.9 |
| Late (epoch 2) | 2500–4332 | 1.7 → 1.5 | ~1.6–1.7 |

Evo2 base model perplexity on random genomic sequence is ~2.0 (loss ~0.7 nats).
Fine-tuned loss will be higher because BGC sequences + conditioning prefixes are
a narrower and more structured distribution than the pretraining data.
A final val loss of ~1.5–1.8 is a reasonable target.

The M1 class match rate from generation samples is the more meaningful quality signal:
- Random baseline: ~25% (TERPENE+RIPP dominate at ~49%; guessing always-TERPENE gives 25%)
- Target for "model is learning": > 50% by step 1000
- Target for "model is working well": > 75% by end of training

---

## 9  Phased conditioning plan

This guide covers Phase 1. Future phases require small changes to the data pipeline
and training launch, not to the training script itself.

### Phase 1 — Class-only (current)

Format: `|COMPOUND_CLASS:{cls}|{tax_tag}{sequence}`
Data: all 346,559 records, uniform format
Goal: class-correct, chassis-appropriate BGC generation
Validation: M1 class match rate + M2 domain recovery

### Phase 2 — Compound conditioning for well-represented compounds

Format for MIBiG records with ≥ 3 examples of the same compound:
`|COMPOUND_CLASS:{cls}||COMPOUND:{tok}|{tax_tag}{sequence}`
All other records: class-only (same as Phase 1)

Data prep change: filter MIBiG JSONL by `compound_token` count threshold before merge.
~45 compounds qualify (≥ 3 examples: `carotenoid` ×17, `o-antigen` ×11, `ectoine` ×10, etc.)

### Phase 3 — SMILES conditioning (future)

Format: `|COMPOUND_CLASS:{cls}||SMILES:{canonical_smiles}|{tax_tag}{sequence}`
Requires: RDKit canonicalisation of 2,118 MIBiG records with SMILES (80.3% coverage)
SACCHARIDE (52.9%) and RIPP (42.7%) fall back to class-only.

## 10  Transposition vs invention — why this matters for interpreting results

This section is reproduced from PROJECT_GUIDE.md §7 for standalone reference.

The model is trained to do **transposition**: given a known compound class (and optionally
a known compound), generate a BGC with the correct biosynthetic architecture expressed
with chassis-appropriate sequence statistics. It is **not** trained to invent new
biosynthetic pathways.

**Transposition is tractable because:**
- What biosynthetic architecture is associated with a class/compound → learned from MIBiG
- What sequences look like in *E. coli* → learned from 6,239 *E. coli* antiSMASH records

**Invention is not tractable because:**
- 91% of MIBiG compound tokens have exactly one training example
- A model cannot learn the chemical meaning of a compound name from a single sequence
- It can at best memorise the one example and adapt it to a new chassis

**Consequence for generated sequences:** A generated sequence conditioned on
`|COMPOUND_CLASS:NRPS||D__BACTERIA;...;S__ESCHERICHIA|` should be annotated as NRPS
by antiSMASH (M1), contain C/A/T domains (M2), and have *E. coli*-appropriate codon
usage (M7). It will not reliably produce any specific known natural product — it will
produce a novel NRPS cluster architecture that has never existed in nature.
That is the intended output.

A full integration smoke test was run on trojai (4 steps, L=1024–4096,
batch=1) to validate the training pipeline before committing to a
multi-day run. Every bug discovered and its fix is recorded here.

### 12.1  Evo2 ↔ DeepSpeed integration bugs (all fixed in `finetune_evo2.py`)

Evo2's `StripedHyena` loader is non-standard and required three patches to cooperate
with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2. These are permanent fixes in the script.

**Bug 1 — Evo2 auto-shards layers across all visible GPUs**

Evo2's vortex loader spreads model layers across every visible CUDA device
(e.g. `Assigned layer_idx=30 to device='cuda:3'`). This is a pipeline-parallel
layout and directly conflicts with ZeRO-2, which expects a full replica on each rank.

*Fix:* At the very start of `main()`, before any CUDA call:
```python
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(local_rank_from_env)
os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"] = "0"
args.local_rank = 0
```
Each worker process is restricted to its own single GPU; Evo2 then sees exactly one
device and places all layers there.

**Bug 2 — Non-contiguous Wqkv tensors after model load**

Evo2 applies `.permute()` post-load to Wqkv projection weights
(`Adjusting Wqkv for column split (permuting rows)`). The permuted tensors are
non-contiguous. DeepSpeed's `_broadcast_model` fails with
`ValueError: Tensors must be contiguous`.

*Fix:* After `evo2.Evo2(...)`, walk all parameters and buffers:
```python
for p in model.parameters():
    if not p.is_contiguous():
        p.data = p.data.contiguous()
```
5 tensors are fixed on each rank.

**Bug 3 — DeepSpeed `WarmupCosineLR` API mismatch**

The original DS config used `warmup_min_lr` and `warmup_max_lr`. In DS 0.18.x,
`WarmupCosineLR.__init__` has a different signature:
```
total_num_steps, warmup_num_steps, warmup_min_ratio, cos_min_ratio, warmup_type
```
Peak LR is taken from the optimizer, not from the scheduler config.

*Fix:* Updated `build_ds_config()` to use the correct parameter names.

### 12.2  Smoke-test progression

| Attempt | Furthest point reached | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | `deepspeed.initialize → _broadcast_model` | Non-contiguous Wqkv + Evo2 multi-GPU auto-shard |
| v2 | `init_distributed` | NCCL `invalid device ordinal` (LOCAL_RANK=3, no cuda:3 after masking) |
| v3 | `init_distributed` | Same; needed both env and `args.local_rank` rewritten |
| v4 | `DeepSpeedEngine._do_args_sanity_check` | `args.local_rank` vs `env['LOCAL_RANK']` mismatch |
| v5 | `_configure_lr_scheduler` | `WarmupCosineLR` API changed in DS 0.18 |
| **v6** | **Forward pass runs (L=4096)** | OOM: ~41.5 GiB used before filter allocation |
| **v7** | **Forward + backward complete (L=1024)** | OOM at `optimizer.step()` allocating `exp_avg_sq` |

v7 confirmed: forward pass, loss computation, and backward pass all work correctly.
The pipeline is sound. The only remaining issue is memory budget for `optimizer.step()`.

### 12.3  Memory analysis — why OOM occurs

At L=1024, batch=1, ZeRO-2 across 4 ranks (3 free GPUs in test):

| Component | Memory (actual, per rank) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| bf16 weights (not sharded by ZeRO-2) | ~13 GB | Replicated on every rank |
| fp32 weight master copy shard | ~8.6 GB | ZeRO-2 divides by world_size |
| Gradient shard | ~4.3 GB | ZeRO-2 divides by world_size |
| StripedHyena activations at L=1024 | ~10–14 GB | Long-conv filter per block is large |
| **Total before optimizer.step()** | **~36–40 GB** | Leaves < 8 GB free |
| AdamW `exp_avg_sq` shard (lazy init) | ~8.6 GB | Fails on first step |

The root cause is StripedHyena's `compute_filter()` which materialises a full
`[poles × channels × L]` tensor during every forward pass. This is not a ZeRO bug —
it's inherent to the architecture. Activation checkpointing at the block level is needed
to reclaim this memory between blocks.

### 12.4  Recommended path forward: LoRA

Full-parameter fine-tuning of Evo2 7B on 4× A40 (48 GB) requires one or more of:

| Option | Memory saving | Implementation risk |
|---|---|---|
| **LoRA on attention + MLP projections** | **~100× optimizer state** | **Low — well-tested with peft** |
| Activation checkpointing (block-level) | ~4× activation memory | Implemented — `--activation-checkpointing` flag (§12.7) |
| ZeRO-3 | Shards weights (~3.2 GB/rank) | High — Evo2 loader resists weight sharding |
| 8-bit AdamW (bitsandbytes) | 4× optimizer state | Medium — requires bitsandbytes install |

**Recommendation: LoRA.** Freeze base weights, add low-rank adapters (rank 16–64) to
the attention `Wq`, `Wk`, `Wv`, `Wo` and optionally MLP `fc1`/`fc2` projections.
Optimizer state drops ~100×, fitting easily on a single rank. The rest of the training
infrastructure (ZeRO-2, WandB, checkpointing, dataset indexing) is unchanged.

For the transposition goal (Phase 1), LoRA is a legitimate scientific choice:
the base model already contains rich sequence representations; adapters steer
generation without altering the underlying genomic language model.

### 12.5  Pre-run checklist

Before starting any real training run:

- [ ] **GPU 0 must be free** — check `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=pid,used_gpu_memory,gpu_uuid --format=csv`. A separate training job (or any resident process > 1 GB) on any of the 4 GPUs will cause OOM.
- [ ] Confirm `wandb login` is active (`wandb status` should show a valid API key in netrc)
- [ ] Run a 10-step smoke test first: `--max-steps 10 --max-seq-len 1024 --batch-size 1 --grad-accum 1`
- [ ] Ensure at least 200 GB disk free for checkpoints (`df -h .`)

### 12.6  LoRA smoke test — bugs fixed and confirmed results

After the full-parameter smoke test confirmed the DeepSpeed integration bugs were fixed
(§12.1), a separate LoRA script (`finetune_evo2_lora.py`) was written and smoke-tested.
Five additional bugs were encountered and fixed before the test passed end-to-end.

**LoRA Bug 1 — `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable` in `get_peft_model`**

peft calls `model.config.to_dict()` when building the adapter. Evo2's config is a
`vortex.model.utils.dotdict`, which returns `None` for missing keys rather than raising
`AttributeError`. The key `to_dict` does not exist, so `model.config.to_dict` is `None`,
and `None()` raises `TypeError`. A standard `hasattr()` check returns `True` (the attribute
"exists" with value `None`), so the peft guard does not catch it.

*Fix:* Inject a working `to_dict` via dict-key assignment (bypasses dotdict attribute
routing):
```python
model.config["to_dict"] = lambda: {
    k: v for k, v in model.config.items() if not callable(v)
}
```

**LoRA Bug 2 — `AttributeError: module 'torch' has no attribute 'float8_e8m0fnu'`**

peft 0.19's `_cast_adapter_dtype` tries to detect float8 support by accessing
`torch.float8_e8m0fnu`. This dtype does not exist in torch 2.5.1.

*Fix:* Pass `autocast_adapter_dtype=False` to `get_peft_model()`:
```python
peft_model = get_peft_model(model, config, autocast_adapter_dtype=False)
```

**LoRA Bug 3 — `RuntimeError: Inference tensors cannot be saved for backward`**

Evo2 sets `inference_mode: True` in its vortex config. Several tensors (notably the
`RMSNorm.scale` buffers in every block) are allocated as **inference-mode tensors** during
the model load. PyTorch's autograd cannot save inference-mode tensors in the backward
graph — they are read-only and outside the autograd engine.

This only appeared with LoRA (not the full-FT script) because full-FT OOMs before
reaching the backward pass, whereas LoRA has enough memory.

*Fix:* After model load, clone every inference-mode parameter and buffer, then call
`model.train()`:
```python
with torch.no_grad():
    for p in model.parameters():
        if hasattr(p.data, "is_inference") and p.data.is_inference():
            p.data = p.data.clone().contiguous()
    for mod_name, mod in model.named_modules():
        for buf_name, buf in list(mod.named_buffers(recurse=False)):
            if buf is not None and hasattr(buf, "is_inference") and buf.is_inference():
                setattr(mod, buf_name, buf.clone().contiguous())
model.train()
```
40 tensors are fixed on each rank (all 40 are inference-mode; they also need
`.contiguous()` for the DeepSpeed broadcast).

**LoRA smoke test — confirmed results (2026-04-15)**

Run: 10 steps, L=1024, batch=1, grad_accum=1, 4× A40, world_size=4.

```
[rank0] Fixed 40 tensors (40 cloned out of inference mode)
[rank0] LoRA applied: r=16  alpha=32  dropout=0.05
[rank0] Trainable params: 28,704,768 / 6,509,764,352  (0.441%)
[rank0] step  1 | ep 0.00 | loss 1.9344 | lr 2.50e-05 | gnorm 0.045 | mem 23.2 GB
[rank0] step  2 | ep 0.00 | loss 1.9303 | ...
...
[rank0] VAL @ step 5:  loss 1.9279  ppl 6.871
[rank0] step  6 | ep 0.00 | loss 1.9250 | ...

[rank0] Adapter saved → checkpoints/smoketest_lora/checkpoints/step_10/adapter
[rank0] Done. step=10  best_val_loss=1.8954
```

All systems confirmed operational:
- ✅ Model loads + LoRA applied (0.44% trainable)
- ✅ Forward pass completes at L=1024 (23.2 GB peak)
- ✅ Backward pass + `optimizer.step()` complete (AdamW state ~336 MB total)
- ✅ Val loss falls over 10 steps (1.9344 → 1.8954 = −2.0%)
- ✅ Checkpoint saved (adapter_config.json + adapter_model.safetensors)
- ✅ WandB metrics logged
- ✅ Resume path tested

**LoRA smoke test progression:**

| Attempt | Furthest point | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | `get_peft_model()` | `dotdict.to_dict` returns None (Bug 1) |
| v2 | `get_peft_model()` | `torch.float8_e8m0fnu` missing (Bug 2) |
| v3 | Backward pass | Inference-mode tensors (Bug 3) |
| v4 | Forward pass (L=4096) | OOM: StripedHyena filter |
| **v5** | **Full 10 steps (L=1024)** | ✅ All confirmed |

**Post-smoke-test review (2026-04-15) — step-counter off-by-one fix**

During a code audit after the smoke test passed, a latent bug was found in both
`finetune_evo2.py` and `finetune_evo2_lora.py`:

```python
# BEFORE (buggy at grad_accum > 1):
model_engine.step()
if model_engine.is_gradient_accumulation_boundary():
    step += 1
    # log, val, checkpoint...
```

DeepSpeed's `is_gradient_accumulation_boundary()` uses the formula
`(micro_steps + 1) % ga == 0` and is designed to be called **before** `engine.step()`
(to predict whether the upcoming step will apply the optimizer). Called **after**
step(), it fires one micro-batch early — at micro-step 7, not micro-step 8 (for ga=8).

At `grad_accum=1` (smoke test config), `(micro_steps+1) % 1 == 0` is always True, so
the bug is invisible — the check coincidentally fires every micro-step, matching the
opt step rate.

At `grad_accum=8` (production config), logged `grad_norm` and `lr` would reflect the
*previous* optimizer step's state, and checkpoints labeled "step N" would actually
capture weights after N−1 optimizer steps.

**Fix (applied to both scripts):** use `model_engine.global_steps`, which DeepSpeed
increments exactly once per real optimizer step inside `_take_model_step`:

```python
# AFTER (correct at any grad_accum):
model_engine.step()
if model_engine.global_steps != step:
    step = model_engine.global_steps
    # log, val, checkpoint...
```

**Verified (2026-04-15):** Re-run with `--grad-accum 2` confirmed the fix. Key output:
```
[rank0] Steps per epoch:    4,332  (grad_accum=2)   ← 8,664 batches / 2 = correct
[rank0] VAL @ step 5:  loss 1.8569  ppl 6.404
[rank0] step   10 | loss 1.8125 | lr 5.00e-05 | gn 2.834   ← real grad_norm (not stale)
[rank0] VAL @ step 10: loss 1.8042  ppl 6.075
[rank0] Reached --max-steps=10; exiting
[rank0] Done. step=10  best_val_loss=1.8042
```
Step 10 was reached after exactly 20 micro-batches (2 per optimizer step). ✅
The NCCL "process group not destroyed" warning on exit is harmless — PyTorch 2.4+
raises it whenever cleanup happens at interpreter shutdown rather than via
`destroy_process_group`. No action needed.

### 12.7  Gputee smoke-benchmark results (2026-04-25)

> **Status: first full sweep complete on gputee (1x H100 80 GB).**
> Runs were executed via the queued wrapper (`scripts/queue_h100_smoke.sh`)
> so each length started only after the GPU was idle. Artefacts:
> `/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/queued_smoke_20260423_152219/`.

The goal is to answer two concrete questions:

1. What is the peak GPU memory, per sequence length, for LoRA on 1× H100 80 GB?
2. Is block-level activation checkpointing required to reach L=32 768?

Procedure:

```bash
micromamba activate bgcmodel
export HF_HOME=/data2/ds85/hf_cache
mkdir -p /data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs

for L in 1024 4096 8192 16384 32768; do
  echo "=== L=$L ==="
  OUT=/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/smoke_L${L}
  deepspeed --num_gpus=1 \
    scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py \
    --train data/processed/splits_combined/val.jsonl \
    --val   data/processed/splits_combined/val.jsonl \
    --output-dir "$OUT" \
    --max-seq-len $L --batch-size 1 --grad-accum 1 \
    --warmup-steps 2 --max-epochs 1 --max-steps 3 \
    --log-every 1 --val-every 99 --save-every 99 \
    --wandb-mode offline  2>&1 | tee "$OUT.log"
done
```

### Queued smoke benchmark (shared-GPU safe)

If the H100 is in use by someone else, use the queued wrapper script instead of
manually polling `nvidia-smi`:

```bash
cd ~/projects/BCGModelling
scripts/queue_h100_smoke.sh
```

What it does:
- waits for GPU idle (`proc_count==0`) and a free-memory threshold before launch
- requires a continuous idle hold window to reduce false starts
- re-checks idleness before **each** length run in the matrix
- runs the full default set: `1024 4096 8192 16384 32768`
- passes `--smoke-pad-to-max-seq-len` to the trainer by default so each
  train micro-batch is padded to the sweep's `--max-seq-len` (memory reflects
  the requested `L` even when individual JSONL samples are shorter). Use
  `scripts/queue_h100_smoke.sh --no-smoke-pad-to-max-seq-len` to restore the
  old natural-length collation behaviour.
- writes per-length stdout logs and a machine-readable summary table

Default result locations:
- Run root: `/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/queued_smoke_<YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS>/`
- Queue/meta log: `.../queue.log`
- Summary table (first file to check): `.../summary.tsv`
- Per-length trainer stdout: `.../smoke_L<LEN>.log`
- Per-length training artefacts: `.../smoke_L<LEN>/` (includes `train_log.jsonl`)

Useful variants:
```bash
# Skip L=1024 if already measured
scripts/queue_h100_smoke.sh --skip-1024

# Tighten "idle" requirements on a busy shared host
scripts/queue_h100_smoke.sh --min-free-mib 79000 --idle-hold-sec 90
```

After completion, copy peak memory from `summary.tsv` into the table below.

With the checkpoint-size fix (§12.8, `exclude_frozen_parameters=True`)
each smoke run writes ~400 MB of output — small enough to leave
everything on `/data2` without per-run cleanup. On the pre-fix script
each run wrote ~25 GB.

Extract peak GPU memory from each `train_log.jsonl` (`gpu_mem_gb[0]`
field per step) and record here:

| L       | Peak GPU mem (H100, LoRA, batch=1) | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------------------------------:|--------|-------|
| 1 024   | **23.52 GB** | ✅ Pass | no-AC baseline (`queued_smoke_20260423_152219`) |
| 4 096   | **47.77 GB** | ✅ Pass | no-AC baseline (`queued_smoke_20260423_152219`) |
| 8 192   | **80.10 GB** | ⚠️ Borderline pass | no-AC baseline (`queued_smoke_20260423_152219`) |
| 16 384  | N/A (OOM before step 1 log) | ❌ OOM | no-AC baseline (`queued_smoke_20260423_152219`) |
| 32 768  | N/A (OOM before step 1 log) | ❌ OOM | no-AC baseline (`queued_smoke_20260423_152219`) |

Interpretation from the 2026-04-25 sweep:

1. **No-checkpoint path does not reach L=32,768.** Both 16,384 and 32,768
   fail in the first forward pass with CUDA OOM.
2. **L=8,192 is technically runnable but operationally unsafe.** The run
   completes 3 steps, but peak memory lands at ~80.1 GB on an 80 GB card,
   leaving negligible headroom for runtime variance or shared-host noise.
3. **L=4,096 is the highest clearly stable no-checkpoint point measured so
   far** at this smoke config (`batch_size=1`, `grad_accum=1`).
4. The OOM message appears together with
   `expandable_segments not supported on this platform`, so allocator
   tuning via `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` is not a
   viable fix on this host. The hint has been stripped from every
   launch command in this guide; do not re-add it.

Project decision from these no-checkpoint results:
- **If training without block-level activation checkpointing:** treat
  `L=4096` as the current safe ceiling.
- **For `L=32768` target training:** no-checkpoint path is invalid; AC is
  required.
- **Do not use the 8,192 no-AC smoke pass as production evidence.** It
  indicates near-saturation, not a comfortable operating point.

Follow-up AC-enabled sweeps (§12.7) populated the §4 “Memory at runtime”
tables; treat the no-AC numbers above as diagnostic ceiling estimates only.

**What "block-level activation checkpointing" actually means.** This is
PyTorch's `torch.utils.checkpoint` API, applied at the granularity of one
StripedHyena block (Evo2 7B has 32 of them). Details worth recording before
anyone implements it:

1. **Mechanics.** During a standard forward pass every intermediate tensor
   needed by backward is kept in memory until gradients are computed.
   Checkpointing instead saves only the *inputs* to a region; when backward
   needs the intermediates, PyTorch re-runs the forward for that region from
   the saved inputs. You pay ~1 extra forward pass per checkpointed region in
   exchange for collapsing its activation footprint to roughly just its
   inputs.
2. **Why "block-level" specifically.** The dominant activation in Evo2 is the
   Hyena `compute_filter()` output — a `[poles × channels × L]` tensor
   materialised *inside every block* on every forward pass and scaling O(L).
   Under a standard forward, all 32 per-block filter tensors coexist in
   memory until backward starts. Wrapping each block as a checkpoint boundary
   means at any moment only one block's filter tensor has to be live — the
   other 31 are discarded and recomputed one at a time during backward. This
   is the "~4× activation memory" saving quoted in §12.4.
3. **Compute cost.** Expect step wall-clock time to increase by ~33% (a
   `1F + 1B` step becomes roughly `2F + 1B` when every block is wrapped).
   The step count is unchanged. The §4 "Steps and time estimate" a-priori
   number does **not** include this factor and must be multiplied by ~1.33
   if the decision rule above selects the checkpointed path.
4. **Dropout / determinism caveat.** The recomputed forward must produce the
   same intermediates as the original. `--lora-dropout` defaults to `0.05`,
   so the checkpoint call must either use `use_reentrant=False` (the
   recommended modern API, which handles RNG state correctly) or explicitly
   preserve and restore RNG state between the two forwards. With a reentrant
   checkpoint and non-zero dropout the recomputed mask will not match the
   original and gradients will be silently wrong. This is a standard
   `torch.utils.checkpoint` footgun and needs to be verified in
   implementation, not assumed.
5. **Implementation surface.** Evo2 does not load through HuggingFace's
   standard `AutoModel` stack (it uses the StripedHyena `vortex` loader), so
   `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()` will not "just work". The
   implementation reaches into the block list and wraps each block's
   `forward` in `torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint(fn, ..., use_reentrant=False)`.
   As of 2026-04-26 this lives in
   `scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py::enable_block_activation_checkpointing()`
   and is toggled via `--activation-checkpointing` /
   `--no-activation-checkpointing` (default: enabled).
   It is applied after `apply_lora()` and before `deepspeed.initialize`, so
   peft's Linear adapters and DeepSpeed's engine wrap both interpose around
   the checkpointed blocks rather than inside them.
6. **Secondary use as an L-lever.** Even if the §12.7 benchmark shows L =
   32 768 fits on the H100 *without* checkpointing, block-level checkpointing
   is still the memory mechanism that would let L be pushed past 32 768 —
   which is the only lever in sight for reducing the ~17% long-sequence tail
   documented in §3. Any decision to explore L > 32 768 should route through
   this option and its compute cost first.

#### Retest with activation checkpointing (completed 2026-04-26)

The AC-enabled rerun completed successfully at all five lengths using:

```bash
cd ~/projects/BCGModelling
# checkpointing is now default-on in finetune_evo2_lora.py
scripts/queue_h100_smoke.sh
```

Run root:
- `/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/queued_smoke_20260426_142830/`

Measured peaks (AC on):

| L       | Peak GPU mem (H100, LoRA, batch=1, AC on) | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------------------------------------:|--------|-------|
| 1 024   | **16.35 GB** | ✅ Pass | down from 23.52 GB (no-AC) |
| 4 096   | **19.10 GB** | ✅ Pass | down from 47.77 GB (no-AC) |
| 8 192   | **22.77 GB** | ✅ Pass | down from 80.10 GB (no-AC) |
| 16 384  | **30.10 GB** | ✅ Pass | no-AC path OOMed |
| 32 768  | **43.92 GB** | ✅ Pass | no-AC path OOMed |

Interpretation from the AC-enabled sweep:

1. **Project target (`L=32768`) is now feasible on 1x H100** for LoRA smoke
   settings, with substantial margin (~44 GB peak on an 80 GB device).
2. **Checkpointing is functioning as intended.** Trainer logs include
   `Activation checkpointing ENABLED: wrapped 32 blocks (use_reentrant=False)`,
   and low-/mid-L memory falls sharply relative to the no-AC baseline.
3. **Next memory frontier is above 32k.** Current data supports probing larger
   windows (`L > 32768`) rather than spending more time re-validating <=32k.

**Caveat on the 2026-04-26 `49152 / 65536 / 98304` probe
(`queued_smoke_20260426_153622`).** That run used natural-length collation
(`batch_size=1` pads only to each sample's token length). The first few
training steps can therefore hit *shorter* sequences than `--max-seq-len`,
which produced identical peak memory and loss traces across those three
lengths — not evidence that 65k/98k tensors actually fit. Re-run that probe
after upgrading `queue_h100_smoke.sh` (default `--smoke-pad-to-max-seq-len`)
and confirm in each `train_log.jsonl` line that `collated_seq_len` equals the
sweep `L` while `content_max_len` reports how many non-pad tokens came from the
JSONL sample.

Follow-up probe (recommended):

```bash
cd ~/projects/BCGModelling
scripts/queue_h100_smoke.sh --lengths "49152 65536 98304"
```

Decision rule for the follow-up:
- If `L=65536` completes with comfortable margin (<~75 GB peak), then
  `L=65536` becomes a practical candidate for long-run planning.
- If `L=98304` OOMs but `L=65536` passes, use the midpoint sweep
  (`73728`, `81920`) to bracket the true ceiling.
- Do not assume `L=131072` is feasible without evidence; linear extrapolation
  from the current AC sweep suggests it likely exceeds 80 GB.

#### Extended-context probe results (completed 2026-04-26 evening)

The follow-up long-context probe was rerun with the upgraded queue script
that defaults to `--smoke-pad-to-max-seq-len`:

- Run root: `/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/queued_smoke_20260426_185444/`
- Summary: `.../summary.tsv`

| L       | Status     | Peak GPU mem (H100, LoRA, batch=1, AC on) | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------------------------------------------:|-------|
| 49 152  | ✅ Pass    | **59.44 GB** | `collated_seq_len=49152` confirmed in `train_log.jsonl` |
| 65 536  | ✅ Pass    | **74.11 GB** | `collated_seq_len=65536` confirmed in `train_log.jsonl` |
| 98 304  | ❌ OOM     | N/A | OOM before step-1 log; `compute_filter()` tried to allocate 24.00 GiB |

Interpretation:

1. **The practical ceiling is now bracketed between 65 536 and 98 304.**
2. **`L=65 536` is feasible but near the H100 limit** (74.11/80 GB under smoke
   settings), so production headroom is limited.
3. **`L=98 304` is not currently feasible** with the present config
   (`batch_size=1`, `grad_accum=1`, AC on).
4. The earlier long-L run (`queued_smoke_20260426_153622`) is now definitively
   superseded by this padded-collation run and should be treated as diagnostic
   history only.

### 12.7.1  Consolidated smoke-test synthesis (current project decision)

Across all completed gputee smoke sweeps:

- **No activation checkpointing (2026-04-25):**
  - stable only to `L=4096`
  - near-saturation at `L=8192` (~80.10 GB)
  - OOM at `L>=16384`
- **With block-level activation checkpointing (2026-04-26):**
  - stable through `L=32768` with large margin (~43.92 GB)
  - stable at `L=49152` (~59.44 GB)
  - stable at `L=65536` (~74.11 GB)
  - OOM at `L=98304`

Current recommendation for production planning:

1. **`L=32768` remains the conservative default** (large margin and strong
   evidence across repeated smoke runs).
2. **`L=65536` is a plausible stretch target** if the project explicitly wants
   more long-sequence coverage and accepts reduced memory headroom + slower
   steps from checkpointing.
3. **Do not plan around `L=98304` or higher** without a model/config change.
4. Any final `L` choice above 32k should be validated again under
   production-like settings (same `grad_accum`, logging/checkpoint cadence,
   and background host conditions) before multi-hour launch.

#### Coverage impact of `L=65536` on current combined train split

Using `data/processed/splits_combined/train.jsonl` (277,238 records), counting
full-length inclusion by `training_text` length **when using head truncation**
(`--long-seq-strategy truncate`):

- `L=32768`: 179,685 / 277,238 = **64.8%** included without truncation
- `L=65536`: 256,875 / 277,238 = **92.7%** included without truncation
- Delta: **+77,190 records** (**+27.8 percentage points**) from 32k -> 65,536

With **`--long-seq-strategy chunk`** at `L=32768`, every nucleotide in every
`sequence` field is supervised across one or more windows (overlap regions are
supervised multiple times). Step count scales with the emitted chunk index
(about **1.4×–1.5×** more optimizer steps per epoch vs truncate at L=32k for
this split, depending on `max_prefix_tokens` from `--auto-prefix-budget` vs a
fixed `--prefix-budget`).

This quantifies the trade-off: 65,536 materially improves full-length coverage,
but requires passing production-like stability checks (not only short smoke
fits) before adoption.

### 12.8  LoRA checkpoint size fix (2026-04-22)

**Discovered during the L=1024 smoke run.** `save_lora_checkpoint`
wrote a 25 GB `mp_rank_00_model_states.pt` file per save — the full
6.5B Evo2 base-model weights — because DeepSpeed's `save_checkpoint`
serialises the whole engine by default. None of those bytes are useful
for LoRA: the frozen base is loaded from the HF cache on every run,
and `PeftModel.from_pretrained` restores the adapter from the peft
checkpoint. The scheduler state and LoRA-trainable optimizer moments
are the only parts needed for resume, and they fit in ~330 MB.

**Fix:** add `exclude_frozen_parameters=True` to the
`model_engine.save_checkpoint(...)` call in
`scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py::save_lora_checkpoint`. This flag was
added to DeepSpeed specifically for the LoRA/frozen-base case and is
handled symmetrically on load — the frozen params stay at whatever the
base-model init produced, and DeepSpeed only restores the non-excluded
ones.

**Also bundled with this fix:** `final_adapter/` is now a
`shutil.copytree` of `checkpoints/step_<N>_final/adapter/` rather than
a second `model_engine.module.save_pretrained(...)` call. The bytes
are identical; removing the redundant peft call eliminates one
opportunity for the two paths to drift.

**Impact on disk footprint** (see §11 table): per-checkpoint drops
from ~25.4 GB → ~390 MB. A full production run at default retention
(`keep_last_ckpts=5`) goes from ~150 GB in flight to ~3 GB.

**Impact on resume correctness:** the `exclude_frozen_parameters=True`
flag means the DeepSpeed checkpoint's `mp_rank_00_model_states.pt` only
contains LoRA-trainable params, not the 6.5B frozen base weights. This
is correct by design — the adapter weights are loaded via
`PeftModel.from_pretrained` and the frozen base is reloaded from the HF
cache on every run — but the resume path required four compatibility
fixes to work with this layout.

**Status: resume verified (2026-05-11).** All four bugs found and fixed.

### 12.8.1  Resume-from-checkpoint verification (2026-05-11)

**Procedure:** two-phase test at L=1024 on gputee, run directly (not
queued — GPU had ~34 GB free alongside another user's process).

- **Phase 1:** 5 steps with `--save-every 2` → checkpoints at steps 2, 4, 5.
  Output: `/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/resume_test_direct/phase1/`
- **Phase 2:** resumed from `phase1/checkpoints/step_2`, ran to step 5.
  Output: `/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/resume_test_direct/phase2/`

**Results:**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Step counter | ✅ Phase 2 starts at step 3, ends at step 5 |
| LR continuity | ✅ Exact match at steps 3, 4, 5 (e.g. step 3 = `4.999999990753644e-05` in both) |
| Loss range | ✅ Same magnitude; values differ as expected (data sampler re-randomises) |
| Checkpoint size | ✅ ~390 MB per checkpoint (`exclude_frozen_parameters` working) |
| GPU peak memory | ✅ 16.35 GB in both phases (identical) |

**Bugs found and fixed in the resume path (all in
`scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py`):**

| # | Error | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable` at `model.config.to_dict()` | Same as initial Bug 1: Evo2's vortex `dotdict` returns `None` for missing attributes instead of raising `AttributeError`. The `apply_lora` path had a shim but `PeftModel.from_pretrained` hits the same call via a different code path. | Inject `model.config["to_dict"]` shim before `PeftModel.from_pretrained`, identical to the `apply_lora` Fix 1. |
| 2 | `AttributeError: module 'torch' has no attribute 'float8_e8m0fnu'` | Same as initial Bug 2: peft 0.19 auto-casts adapters to fp8 dtypes not present in torch 2.5. `apply_lora` passed `autocast_adapter_dtype=False` to `get_peft_model`, but `PeftModel.from_pretrained` has its own separate parameter. | Pass `autocast_adapter_dtype=False` to `PeftModel.from_pretrained`. |
| 3 | `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transformers.integrations.tensor_parallel'` | peft 0.19's `set_peft_model_state_dict` unconditionally imports `ALL_PARALLEL_STYLES`, `ColwiseParallel`, `EmbeddingParallel`, `RowwiseParallel` from a module that only exists in transformers ≥ 4.50. We're pinned to 4.46.3. The initial `get_peft_model` path doesn't call `set_peft_model_state_dict`, so this never surfaced before. | Register a stub `types.ModuleType` at `transformers.integrations.tensor_parallel` with dummy names before calling `from_pretrained`. The TP sharding code never fires in our single-GPU setup (requires `_hf_tp_plan` / `_hf_device_mesh` on layers). |
| 4 | `RuntimeError: Missing key(s) in state_dict` (all frozen base-model keys) | DeepSpeed's `load_checkpoint` calls `load_state_dict` in strict mode by default. The checkpoint only contains LoRA-trainable params (because of `exclude_frozen_parameters=True`), but the PeftModel's state dict includes all frozen `base_model.*` keys. | Pass `load_module_strict=False` to `model_engine.load_checkpoint` in `load_lora_checkpoint()`. The adapter weights are already correct from `PeftModel.from_pretrained`; only the optimizer/scheduler state and client_state (step counter, `best_val_loss`) are needed from the DeepSpeed checkpoint. |

All four bugs are in the resume code path only — the forward (initial
training) path is unaffected. Bugs 1–3 are peft 0.19 / torch 2.5 /
transformers 4.46.3 version-gap issues; Bug 4 is a consequence of
`exclude_frozen_parameters=True` interacting with the peft wrapper's
expanded state dict.

A queued resume-test script is available at
`scripts/queue_h100_resume_test.sh` for re-verification after any
checkpoint-related changes.

## 11  Files written by the training script

LoRA checkpoints use a different structure from full fine-tune:
the adapter weights are saved via `peft`'s `save_pretrained` (two small
files), while the DeepSpeed scheduler/optimizer state is saved alongside.
**The frozen base-model weights are intentionally excluded from every
checkpoint** — they already live in the HF cache as `evo2_7b.pt`
(~14 GB) and are reloaded via `Evo2("evo2_7b")` at the start of every
run. Re-serialising them into every checkpoint would add ~25 GB per
save for no resume benefit. The excl-frozen behaviour is controlled by
`exclude_frozen_parameters=True` in `save_checkpoint()` (see
`save_lora_checkpoint` in `scripts/finetune_evo2_lora.py`).

Single-GPU on gputee means only one ZeRO rank (`rank_0`); on trojai
the `step_N/` directories also held `zero_pp_rank_{1,2,3}_…` shards.
Those are not produced at `world_size=1`.

**Per-checkpoint disk footprint (gputee, with `--lora-r 16`):**

| Artefact | Size | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `adapter/adapter_model.safetensors` | ~55 MB | 28.7M params × 2 bytes (bf16) |
| `bf16_zero_pp_rank_0_mp_rank_00_optim_states.pt` | ~330 MB | fp32 master + m + v for 28.7M params |
| `mp_rank_00_model_states.pt` | ~few MB | scheduler + client_state + trainable params only |
| **Total per `step_N/`** | **~390 MB** | |
| `keep_last_ckpts=5` steady state | ~2 GB | 5 × 390 MB |
| `best/` + `step_<N>_final/` + `final_adapter/` | +~830 MB | |
| **Typical full-run on-disk max** | **~3 GB** | plus `plots/`, logs, optional `samples/` |

For comparison, the pre-fix layout wrote the full 6.5B base model into
`mp_rank_00_model_states.pt` at every save (~25 GB per checkpoint, so
`keep_last_ckpts=5` meant 127 GB in flight plus another 25 GB for the
`best/` copy). The `exclude_frozen_parameters=True` change makes that
go away without affecting resume semantics — see §12.8.

### Final adapter export

At end-of-training the script additionally writes:
```
/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/phase1_lora/final_adapter/
├── adapter_config.json
└── adapter_model.safetensors
```

This is a **copy** of the adapter from the most recent `step_<N>_final/`
checkpoint (via `shutil.copytree`, not a second `peft.save_pretrained`
call — guarantees byte-identical contents). The `final_adapter/` path
is the canonical inference-time load target and will not be affected
by later retention-based cleanup of the `checkpoints/` subtree.

### Using the adapter for inference

```python
from peft import PeftModel
import evo2

base_model = evo2.Evo2("evo2_7b")
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(
    base_model,
    "/data2/ds85/bgcmodel_runs/phase1_lora/final_adapter",
)
model.eval()
```
